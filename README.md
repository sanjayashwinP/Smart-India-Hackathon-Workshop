## 1️ Problem Overview

Railway stations are among the most crowded and complex public infrastructures in India. Large stations contain multiple platforms, entry and exit points, ticket counters, food courts, waiting halls, restrooms, escalators, elevators, and service offices.

Passengers—especially first-time travelers, senior citizens, tourists, and persons with disabilities—face difficulties such as:

- Finding platforms on time  
- Locating essential facilities  
- Navigating frequent layout changes  
- Understanding signboards in unfamiliar languages  

These challenges negatively impact passenger experience and often lead to missed trains, congestion, and stress.

## 2️ Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to design and implement an intelligent navigation system that:

- Provides accurate indoor navigation inside railway stations  
- Supports real-time route guidance  
- Enhances accessibility for differently-abled passengers  
- Works seamlessly across mobile applications and digital kiosks  
- Integrates with existing railway digital services  

---

## 3️ Proposed Solution

We propose **RailNav AI**, a multi-platform smart navigation ecosystem designed specifically for railway stations.

### Solution Highlights

- 3D interactive station maps  
- Real-time indoor navigation  
- Voice-guided assistance for hands-free use  
- QR-based instant navigation from any location  
- Accessibility-aware route planning  
- Multilingual user interface
